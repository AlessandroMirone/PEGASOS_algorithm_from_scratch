# PEGASOS_algorithm_from_scratch
Implementation of the PEGASOS algorithm with Gaussian kernels for multiclass classification (one-vs-all encoding)

PLEASE note that the code provided in this repository is intended for academic purposes only. It was created to show how to write a working PEGASOS algorithm in base python starting from ML theory; it is NOT optimized nor scalable, so avoid using this code for anything more than reference when building your own project. 
If you are set on using a PEGASOS algorithm for classification problems, I suggest looking for specific packages.

Thank you for your attention.
